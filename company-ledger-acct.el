;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Provides auto completion for account names, based on string entered.
;; The string entered triggers a completion as long as it matches any
;; part of the account name. Once a candidate is selected the account name
;; is inserted and a currency symbol (if provided) is appended.
;; The currency symbol is defined by company-ledger-acct-currency-symbol.
;; This requires that a set of accounts are pre configured using the
;; /accounts/ keyword, and the file where these definitions are
;; available is defined in the variable company-ledger-acct-master-file.
;; A possible configuration using use-package :
;; (use-package ledger-mode
;;    :mode "\\.ledger"
;;    :hook  ((ledger-mode . flycheck-mode)
;;            (ledger-mode . (lambda ()
;;                             (set (make-local-variable 'company-backends)
;;                                   (cons '(company-ledger-acct company-yankpad)
;;                                          company-backends)))))
;;    :custom (company-ledger-acct-master-file "~/accounts.dat")
;;            (company-ledger-acct-currency-symbol "â‚¹"))
